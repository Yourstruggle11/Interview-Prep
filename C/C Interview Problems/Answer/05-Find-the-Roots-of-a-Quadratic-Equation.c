// TO solve this we should know what exactly Quadractic-Equation is!
/*
*In algebra, a quadratic equationis any equation that can be rearranged in standard form as
*  'ax^2+bx+c=0'
*  where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers, where a â‰  0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic, as there is no 'ax^2' term.

*The term 'b^2 - 4ac' is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It tells the nature of the roots.

*If the discriminant is greater than 0, the roots are real and different.
*If the discriminant is equal to 0, the roots are real and equal.
*If the discriminant is less than 0, the roots are complex and different.
